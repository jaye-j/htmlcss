<h1>Pokémon GOLD & SILVER</h1>
<body>
    <p>Pokémon Gold Version and Pokémon Silver Version are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. They are the first installments in the second generation of the Pokémon video game series. They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. Pokémon Crystal, an enhanced version, was released roughly a year later in each region. In 2009, on the 10th anniversary of the games, Game Freak remade Gold and Silver for the Nintendo DS as Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver.

        The games introduce 100 new species of Pokémon, and follow the progress of the central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master Pokémon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between these games and their predecessors in order to fully complete the games' Pokédex. The Johto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games.
        
        Pokémon Gold and Silver were critically acclaimed upon release. They are considered by some to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation of console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of Pokémon Red and Blue as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of Red and Blue and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units.
        
        On June 6, 2017, The Pokémon Company announced via a Pokémon Direct broadcast that the games would be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on September 22, 2017 in all regions. Pokémon Crystal was also eventually re-released, on January 26, 2018.</p>
